        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreimo#Main_characters">Ruri</a> is a 15 year-old otaku girl who lives near Kirino and later enrolls in Kyosuke's school. She often wears gothic lolita clothing based on a character from her favorite anime, even during hot weather, and will sometimes add cat ears and a tail.</p>
        <p>Due to both of their tsundere-type personalities, she constantly clashes with Kirino. </p>
